# Built-in Unity shaders (with tab indents)

This repo is originally created for my own personal usage. It contains the source Unity's shaders, but with a couple of modifications:
* Tabs instead of spaces
* slightly different indents

Apart from that, it's the Unity's shaders as they are, with no change in their behavior.
I commit shaders for new Unity versions as I need them.

The only actual piece of my code here that worth anything is a python script performing that re-format. The rest of the repo is entirely generated by it, from the source Unity shaders.

This script depends on my own non-shared python package, but that dependency can be removed quite easily.
